# Bamazon-SQL
A SQL-based node app that functions like an Amazon style marketplace.

As functionality is based on local instances of a database, below you'll find a walkthrough of how the app works on the three user levels: Customer, Manager, and Supervisor.

##Customer

When using Bamazon, Customers are given the functionality to "Buy" a listed product from Bamazon.

If the quantity they request is available, the purchase will go through and update the quantity of the products database. If there request exceeds the quantity available they will get an error request.


##Manager
Managers have the added ability to check on stock of items, add new items, update stock, and check which items have low stock.
